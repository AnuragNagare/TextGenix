 🔧 Troubleshooting

 Common Issues

spaCy Model Not Found
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Import Errors for Optional Libraries
- The system works with basic functionality even if some libraries are missing
- Install missing libraries individually as needed

Performance Issues
- For large documents, processing may take longer
- Reduce quality threshold or word length ranges for faster processing

Memory Issues
- Close other applications if processing very large documents
- Consider processing documents in smaller sections

 📝 Sample Usage

 Test Document
Create a text file with this content to test the system:

```
The contract has important terms that both parties must follow.
Our company had good results this year with big improvements.
The system works by using advanced methods to process data.
```

Expected enhancements:
- "important" → "critical"
- "good" → "exceptional"
- "big" → "substantial"
- "advanced methods" → "sophisticated methodologies"
